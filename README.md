## About me!

I am a senior at Moravian University studying English writing arts and multimedia journalism. I have written for [The Comenian Newspaper] (https://comenian.org/staff_name/lola-offenback/) since my freshman year and am now the managing editor. Additionally, I guest-reported for Lehigh Daily and interned for Haymarket Media, writing for MM+M, a medical marketing news outlet. Community is at the heart of my reporting. I want my articles to provide unbiased, accessible information for the public to make informed decisions in their everyday lives!

In addition to my reporting and writing, I have been building multimedia skills in journalism and other adjacent fields. I am the Editor-in-Chief of The Manuscript literary magazine, where I oversee edit and layout of a yearly print and online product. I have experience with InDesign for both newspaper and magazine layouts. I launched the podcast Mo' to Write for Moravian's Writing Center, covering writing techniques, concepts, pedagogy, and more. I am now working on a passion project podcast about navigating life as a woman in your 20s. I have taken countless images for The Comenian's webpage and social media, and took a Digital Photography class to further hone my skills.

## Bethlehem, PA Tourism Data Report 

Data from visitpa.com from the 2024 Economic Impact of Visitors in Pennsylvania Annual Report shows that tourism is steadily on the rise in the state and in the Lehigh Valley. There are many contributing factors in Bethlehem that have helped increase tourism to the area, including the newly designated UNESCO Moravian World Heritage Site, Historic Hotel Bethlehem positioning and promoting itself as an international travel destination, and multiple cultural festivals (including Musikfest, Celtic Classic, Oktoberfest, and more). The region and state are steadily recovering from COVID-19 travel declines.
