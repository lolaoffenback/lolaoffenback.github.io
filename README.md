## About me!

I am a senior at Moravian University studying English writing arts and multimedia journalism. I have written for [The Comenian Newspaper] (https://comenian.org/staff_name/lola-offenback/) since my freshman year and am now the managing editor. Additionally, I guest-reported for Lehigh Daily and interned for Haymarket Media, writing for MM+M, a medical marketing news outlet. Community is at the heart of my reporting. I want my articles to provide unbiased, accessible information for the public to make informed decisions in their everyday lives!

In addition to my reporting and writing, I have been building multimedia skills in journalism and other adjacent fields. I am the Editor-in-Chief of The Manuscript literary magazine, where I oversee edit and layout of a yearly print and online product. I have experience with InDesign for both newspaper and magazine layouts. I launched the podcast Mo' to Write for Moravian's Writing Center, covering writing techniques, concepts, pedagogy, and more. I am now working on a passion project podcast about navigating life as a woman in your 20s. I have taken countless images for The Comenian's webpage and social media, and took a Digital Photography class to further hone my skills.
